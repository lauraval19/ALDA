# Data Generation Workshop
A program was made that allows you to create a random data table with 20 columns, into this columns exist a unique key for each line of the datatset called "ID" and the column called "Owner ID" it's number of owner identification, the topic of the dataset is about vehicle information next to the owner's information.
## Understanding :dart:
This dataset contains a columns called ID,Country,License Plate,Vehicle Brand,Vehicle Classification,Year Vehicle,Color,CylinderCapacity (cc),Fuel type,Imported,Service,Engine power (Kw),Engine Size (L),Gearbox type,Owner's ID,Owner name,owner last name,Owner age,Owner's email. This information allows you make a analyze the tend brand car also owner's interest of the vehicles, in addition allows you analyze and predict the increase in population or in the sells of vehicles and know the CO2 emission generated by these vehicles.
